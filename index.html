                When Workpath receives a request from you, it looks for three
                groups of information:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Your Company Information: Your ID, account number for your lab
                  partner, name/NPI of the Provider requesting the test, the
                  unique identifier you use for your patient who needs the test.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your Patient’s Information*: First/Last Name, Phone #, DOB,
                  Email, Address, and Gender.
                </li>
                <li>
                  What Test You Are Requesting: an ID, ICD codes that were
                  assigned, and any documents or notes you need the field
                  specialists to have.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                *The next step below will confirm this information directly with
                your patient so if you are unsure of some of the fields or their
                accuracy, do not worry, we will grab that for you! We require an
                accurate phone number for logistics updates.

              In your request, we asked you to provide as much information on
              your patient as possible. Here’s what happens next:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We contact the patient to fill in any missing contact info.
              </li>
              <li>
                We ask the patient for self-payment or insurance information
                which is then sent to the lab for billing purposes (Policy
                Number, Group Number, etc.).
              </li>
              <li>
                We ask the patient what day works best for their appointment and
                recommended times based on the availability of our specialists
                in the area.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Workpath also makes sure to inform the patient about any needs
              from the test they will be taking (ex. If they need to fast).

          <p>
              Once we’ve received all of the required information from the
              patient, we’ll order the test for the patient from our lab partner
              and schedule the appointment for the patient’s in-home visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we’ll look for the next available time for a specialist who
              is certified to complete the test, has availability in that area,
              and who can tackle the appointment the soonest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once a specialist claims the appointment and confirms that they
              can complete the specific test for that patient at that location,
              the patient will receive a text message confirming the date and
              time of their appointment, and information on their specialist.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the patient receiving a confirmation, you will
              receive a response including the created appointment’s ID,
              information on the specialist, the status of the appointment, and
              other information on what to expect from the appointment.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there are unforeseen circumstances including bad weather,
              illness, or supply issues and the specialist has to reschedule or
              release the appointment to another specialist, both you and the
              patient will be updated immediately.

                sent confirmations that the specialist has all necessary
                equipment and are ready for the appointment.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the day of, your patient will receive an SMS message letting

                When the specialist has arrived, the patient will receive an SMS
                message notifying them. The specialist will introduce
                themselves, confirm the patient’s information, and start the
                appointment.

                Workpath provides a mobile app to the specialists that
                highlights the steps they need to take to complete the
                appointment - such as information that they may need to gather
                from the patient. These steps are pre-determined based on the
                test that you requested.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the in-home visit, the specialist will ask your patient
                to complete a few forms for the lab to confirm their
                information, self-payment or insurance eligibility, and the test
                being performed. These will be delivered to the lab along with
                any specimens taken.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the specialist has finished all of the steps with your

            Once the lab receives the specimen and patient forms, they

            What Workpath does for you here is take the large, difficult to
